Specification
Your website must meet the following requirements:








Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
You may encounter a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Not to worry! This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.
The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.7
